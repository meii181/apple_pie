People who try Danish dishes often find some that are quite appealing. Their pastries are especially loved by people in all regions of the world.  The rye bread made in Denmark is especially tasty and is used for open faced sandwiches. Typically, their sandwiches are not made with two pieces of bread, as they are in many places.  Danish cuisine has changed in the recent past. They make more \u201clight\u201d meals than they used to and fewer \u201cheavy\u201d meals. The more modern dishes have been heavily influenced by Italy, France and Spain. Older Danes, many times, are still happier making more traditional dishes.
